# Skill tree journey ðŸŽ®

**Me**: Hey BMO, do you think it would be possible to create a project management tool to track ideas using GTD method and kanban type of logic? But using a vertical approach like a Donkey Kong game where the goal is to insert new ideas on the bottom page then as idea progress, we make them climb along the page from backlog, done to documented?

This is such a creative idea - combining Donkey Kong's vertical climbing with project management! _excited whirring noises_

## About this project
This repository was born from a common painpoint: traditional learning resources often don't align with individual needs and learning paths.
While there are countless tutorials and courses available, they rarely match to the learner's specific context, prior knowledge, and goals.
But what if we could design our own learning journeys? And better yet - what if we could make the process of learning how to learn more engaging and accessible?
That's exactly what this project explores:

1. Using AI as a learning design partner to create personalized learning paths
2. Documenting the process of working with AI to help others do the same
3. "Walking the talk" by applying this method to build a gamified skill-tracking system

In this case, I'll be learning to build tools that help design and track my learning journeys, using classic RPG game mechanics as a framework. 
Breaking down complex skills into progressive levels, mapping skill dependencies, and creating "boss battles" as real-world project challenges combines proven methodologies like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) with engaging game narratives.
This repository serves both as a meta-guide for designing AI-assisted learning journeys and as a living example of the process in action.

## The Epic quest framework

### Core mechanics
```
Level 0: "Drawing the Map"
â”œâ”€â”€ Known territory (What you know)
â”œâ”€â”€ Visible challenges (What you know you don't know)
â””â”€â”€ The "Fog of War" (Unknown unknowns that reveal as you progress)
```

### Quest Hierarchy
```
Epic Quest (The full journey)
â””â”€â”€ Major Quests (Significant skill areas)
    â””â”€â”€ Quests (Individual skills)
        â””â”€â”€ Missions (Learning components)
            â””â”€â”€ Tasks (Specific actions)
```

Example structure:
```
Epic: Learn to build web learning tools
â”œâ”€â”€ Quest Line: Development environment
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Quest: Raspberry Pi setup
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Mission: Basic configuration
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task: Install OS
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task: Network setup
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Task: SSH access
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Boss Battle: Multi-container setup
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Victory Conditions: 
â”‚       - System accessible remotely
â”‚       - Development environment ready
â””â”€â”€ [Fog of War] More quests reveal as you progress
```

### Framework Components

1. **Initial Survey (Level 0)**
   - Player Interview (What do you want to build?)
   - Skill Assessment (What do you know?)
   - Path Drawing (AI-assisted journey mapping)

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Task completion
   - Mission success criteria
   - Quest achievements
   - Boss battle victories

3. **Victory Conditions (OKRs)**
   - Objectives: Clear goals for each level
   - Key Results: Measurable outcomes
   - Proof of Work: Documentation/demos

4. **Progression System**
   - Skills unlock new areas
   - Challenges reveal hidden paths
   - Knowledge opens new possibilities

### ðŸ”§ Tools I'll use
- VSCode with Jupyter extension
- GitHub for progress tracking
- SQLite for achievement database
- Various coding tools as we progress
