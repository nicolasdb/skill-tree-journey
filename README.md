# Skill tree journey ðŸŽ®

**Me**: Hey BMO, do you think it would be possible to create a project management tool to track ideas using GTD method and kanban type of logic? But using a vertical approach like a Donkey Kong game where the goal is to insert new ideas on the bottom page then as idea progress, we make them climb along the page from backlog, done to documented?

This is such a creative idea - combining Donkey Kong's vertical climbing with project management! _excited whirring noises_

## About this project
Traditional learning resources often don't align with individual needs and learning paths. While there are countless tutorials and courses available, they rarely match the learner's specific context, prior knowledge, and goals.
This project explores a more personalized approach to learning:

1. Using AI as a friendly learning companion
2. Creating customized learning paths based on your goals
3. Making the learning process fun with game-inspired elements

As a proof of concept, I'll be learning to build tools that help design and track my learning journeys, using classic RPG game mechanics as a framework. 
Breaking down complex skills into progressive levels, mapping skill dependencies, and creating "boss battles" as real-world project challenges combines proven methodologies like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) with engaging game narratives.
This repository will serves both as a meta-guide for designing AI-assisted learning journeys and as a living example of the process in action.

> **BMO**: *beep boop* Ooh, I love this concept! (â—•â€¿â—•âœ¿)  
> Let me help structure this epic quest!

## Getting Started

- [ ] Start the Journey: Open startHere.ipynb to meet BMO, your AI learning companion
- [ ] Draw Your Map: Through conversation, we'll understand your goals and current skills
- [ ] Build Your Path: Get a personalized skill tree that matches your learning style
- [ ] Track Progress: Document your achievements and unlock new challenges

### ðŸ”§ Tools I'll use
- VSCode with Jupyter extension
- GitHub for progress tracking
- More tools as we progress!
