# Learning Journey Prompt

Hi Claude! I'm nicolas and I'd like to create a gamified learning journey. Here's my context:

<learning_profile>
- Learning topic: I want to learn how to sell things
- Current level: i followed a basic course to understand how to qualify a prospect and focus on the persieved value of the offer but not yet there
- Time available: 1 hours per week
- Learning style: video or even video game is awesome to practice in safe-space like a sandbox. 
- Preferred pace: mixed is good, self-paced but within an overall structure to see my progression
- Project preference: small like blocks I can then pill up to build bigger project
</learning_profile>

Could you help me design a progressive learning path using game mechanics like levels, skills, and boss battles?
