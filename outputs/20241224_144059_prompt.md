# Learning Journey Prompt

Hi Claude! I'm nicolas and I'd like to create a gamified learning journey. Here's my context:

<learning_profile>
- Learning topic: I would like to learn about parcours
- Current level: none, just watched some videos online
- Time available: 4 hours per week
- Learning style: hands-on practice and video for inspiration
- Preferred pace: self-paced but with overall structure, I like to see I'm progressing
- Project preference: many small project, like micro-certifications, they are small blocks of knowledge I can then put together for bigger project
</learning_profile>

Could you help me design a progressive learning path using game mechanics like levels, skills, and boss battles?
